417-16400: Chinese TrueType font for 9.1

FF_CONTACTS_NICKNAME,"The nickname functionality needs a feature flag for the following reasons:
-Phonebook2 component exports a central repository initialization file, which is used to improve the Phonebook application launch -The initialization file is read by the Symbian Contacts model server to initialize the Contacts view during the device boot sequence
 * S60 specifications define which fields take part in the device's contact name creation (first name, last name, company name)
 * The nickname requirement changes the S60 name creation rules, by adding the contacts nickname field to the above list of fields
 * Therefore the content of the Contacts view needs to be initialized differently depending on whether the nickname feature is enabled or disabled
 * The initialization file contains the configuration of the view, e.g. the contact fields which are used for sorting the Phonebook names list view
 * A feature flag is needed which allows Phonebook2 to export the correct variant of the Contact view initilization file
 * There is a considerable RAM usage penalty associated with keeping the nickname field in the contact view when the nickname feature is disabled
 * For further description of the Symbian Contacts view initilization see \src\common\generic\app-engines\cntmodel\documentation\Contacts_How-To_Improve_Application_Start-up_Time.doc
-Run-time variation can be used inside the Phonebook2 application to configure the application sort order

- FF_EMPTY_COMMSDAT: Completely empty CommsDat is used. Typically needed as the base when creating operator variants with Configuration Tool and CommsDatCreator. Same as old FF_COMMSDAT_GENERATION_FROM_XML.

- FF_VANILLA_COMMSDAT: Otherwise empty CommsDat but the S60 default destinations (Internet, MMS and Operator) as well as the Easy WLAN IAP (in case of WLAN product) is included. This is suitable for vanilla variants of the phones.

- FF_RND_COMMSDAT: Platform releases contain typically the RND CommsDat that has Nokia Test Network IAPs as well as some Finnish operator IAPs (DNA, Sonera, Elisa) for RnD purposes.

Maximum of one of these flags should be defined at the time. 

If none of the override flags is defined then the used CommsDat depends on the image type: vanilla CommsDat is used for PRD image and RnD CommsDat for the RnD image. This is typically how it should be and the override flags should only be used if some special functionality is needed.
