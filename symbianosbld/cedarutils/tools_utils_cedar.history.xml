    Build the H4 textshell ROM in v9.3, v9.4 and v9.5 configurations, (and correct the name in the vFuture configuration).
  </minorchange>

  <minorchange revision="004">
    Change the vFuture textshell ROM to be a pure XIP ROM, so that building the ROM confirms that all static links are satisfied.
  </minorchange>

  <minorchange revision="003">
    Make the proposed changes to the Schedule 12 file for v9.4, (and propagate the changes to v9.5 and vFuture). These changes are not yet confirmed by Product Management, and will remain as "Draft" until formally approved.
  </minorchange>

  <minorchange revision="002">
    Enable system-wide #defines appropriate to v9.5 and the current state of the codeline. The enabled #defines are:
    
    SYMBIAN_CRYPTOSPI -- (PREQ57)
    SYMBIAN_PROCESS_MONITORING_AND_STARTUP -- (PREQ871, PREQ1089)
    SYMBIAN_WSERV_AND_CONE_MULTIPLE_SCREENS -- (PREQ1227)
    SYMBIAN_LFFS_SIBLEY_NORFLASH -- (PREQ912)
    SYMBIAN_C32_SERCOMMS_V2 -- (PREQ890)
    
    Enabling the #define does not imply that the associated PREQ is complete.
  </minorchange>

  <minorchange revision="001">
    Removed SYMBIAN_COMMSDEBUGUTILITY_V2 system-wide #define, from v9.5 onwards, because it will never be used.
  </minorchange>
